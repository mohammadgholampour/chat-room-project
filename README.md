# Chat-Room-Socket-Programming-Python

Client-Server Chat Room Implemented by Socket Programming in Python

### Getting Started

1. Open a terminal and create a chat room by running Server.py
``` bash
cd <root>
python Server.py
```

2. In another terminal, create and add a client to the chat room by running Client.py
``` bash
python Client.py [name] # Don't forget to declare the client's name
```

3. You can add more clients in the room by running more Client.py in other terminals.

4. Let's have a chat!!!

### Demo

1. First, I have created 3 terminals and run the code as following.
